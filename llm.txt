re-word As an extension, the model was re-trained and tested on the 2016 CCES dataset using analogous predictors, but omitting the urban-rural divide because that information was not included
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a polished rewording of your sentence:

"As a further step, the model was retrained and evaluated on the 2016 CCES dataset using similar predictors, excluding the urban-rural distinction since that variable was not available."

If you want, I can also suggest an even more concise, academic-style version suitable for a paper. Do you want me to do that?

fix this ces16_subset2 = ces16_subset[
    (ces16_subset['race'] <= 8) &
    (ces16_subset['gender'] <= 2) &
    (ces16_subset['CC16_320a'] < 8) &
    (ces16_subset['CC16_303'] < 8) &
    (ces16_subset['CC16_302'] < 8) &
    (ces16_subset['CC16_410a'].isin('1.0', '2.0', na=False)) &
    (ces16_subset['birthyr'].notna()) &
    (ces16_subset['educ'] <= 6) &
    (ces16_subset['inputstate'].notna())
]
ChatGPT said:

Your issue is with this part:

ces16_subset['CC16_410a'].isin('1.0', '2.0', na=False)


isin() expects a list or iterable, not multiple string arguments. You also can’t pass na=False directly; instead, you should handle missing values separately or use fillna.

Here’s the corrected version:

ces16_subset2 = ces16_subset[
    (ces16_subset['race'] <= 8) &
    (ces16_subset['gender'] <= 2) &
    (ces16_subset['CC16_320a'] < 8) &
    (ces16_subset['CC16_303'] < 8) &
    (ces16_subset['CC16_302'] < 8) &
    (ces16_subset['CC16_410a'].isin(['1.0', '2.0'])) &
    (ces16_subset['birthyr'].notna()) &
    (ces16_subset['educ'] <= 6) &
    (ces16_subset['inputstate'].notna())
]


If you want to ignore missing values safely, use fillna:

ces16_subset2 = ces16_subset[
    (ces16_subset['race'] <= 8) &
    (ces16_subset['gender'] <= 2) &
    (ces16_subset['CC16_320a'] < 8) &
    (ces16_subset['CC16_303'] < 8) &
    (ces16_subset['CC16_302'] < 8) &
    (ces16_subset['CC16_410a'].fillna('').isin(['1.0', '2.0'])) &
    (ces16_subset['birthyr'].notna()) &
    (ces16_subset['educ'] <= 6) &
    (ces16_subset['inputstate'].notna())
]


Would you like me to add a .copy() at the end to avoid SettingWithCopy warnings?

KeyError: 'econ_past_year'
ChatGPT said:

This error:

KeyError: 'econ_past_year'


means that your DataFrame does not have a column named econ_past_year.

This can happen because:

You misspelled the column name.

The column doesn’t exist in the dataset.

You modified the DataFrame earlier and dropped or renamed that column.

The dataset you loaded isn’t the one you think it is (e.g., wrong file, different version).

How to debug

Run these commands to inspect your DataFrame:

print(ces16_subset.columns)


or

list(ces16_subset.columns)


Then look for the closest match — maybe it’s named something like econpast_year, econ_pastyr, or something else.

Fixing it

If it’s just a typo, correct the column name in your code.

If the column is genuinely missing, you need to:

Load the correct dataset, or

Remove or replace that filter if it’s optional for your analysis.

Would you like to show me the output of ces16_subset.columns? That way, I can help you identify the right column name.
